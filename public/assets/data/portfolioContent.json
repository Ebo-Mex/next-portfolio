                "The team took the decision of using a blue cardboard since a solid color would make it easier for the drone to get closer. This part of the algorithm made use of OpenCV to detect the color, and area of the figure, the area allowed us to know the approximate distance to the target. Finally, to send the movement instructions we made use of ROS.",
                "In the center of the cardboard a QR code was placed to make the algorithm more robust against possible similar objects in the environment. ZBar was used to make sure that the QR code was correct and keep track of it with the help of OpenCV.",
                "After the successful testing (shown in the Gallery Section), a cardboard cube was going to be manufactured to avoid losing the target in case that the judge decided to rotate the object. However, due to the cancellation of the tournament as a consequence of the current pandemic, and to avoid unnecessary health risks, the project was cancelled."

The game was powered using a DC voltage source that we previously build.",

My main goal is to obtain a certification to demonstrate the skills acquired during this period.",
        "I have a bachelor's degree in mechatronics engineering and thanks to my dedication I obtained the award for performance excellence in México for the 2020 period.",
        "During my career, working with microcontrollers and the IoT ignited my interest in computer vision and this inspired me to go even beyond and learn to implement machine learning models for object recognition and tracking in my final year.",
        "My mechatronics background taught me to adapt to new scenarios, to learn fast and to be a problem solver. When I began to take part in more ambitious programming projects, I realized that my past experiences still had value in this field. Nowadays, when I work in a project, I use it as an opportunity to learn something new and add more value to the experience.",
        "On my free time, I love playing PC videogames. At the moment I am trying to finish Hades. As a fun fact, I also love playing Sudoku, so I try to play at least once a day to keep my skills fresh. I like watching series, anime, and manga from time to time, currently I am watching Invincible (pretty good if you like superhero stories with a dark twist) and I am reading the last part of the JoJo's manga."
